# FormulaForcePedals2USB
**Convert Logitech Formula Force EX pedals to USB using Arduino Leonardo**


Pedals are connected to wheel using RS232 interface and the idea was to plug them into PC directly, without using the wheel, in order for them to be used like **rudder pedals** in flight sims. This is done with Arduino Leonardo, using [MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary).

Hardware needed:
* ATmega32u4 compatible development board (Arduino Leonardo)
* Female RS232 DB9 connector
* Wires
* Logitech Formula Force EX wheel and pedals (obviously)
